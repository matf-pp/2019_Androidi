    <string name="about_gameplay">Player goal is to collect resources
            and to choose upgrades that best fit his gamestyle in order
            to have efficient progress. As game pass it becomes more challenging
            and requires a player to carefully balance between resources, as poor
            choices will significantly slow down his progress.
