# Androidi

The idea of a project is to make classic clicker/idle game. 
Player goal is to collect resources and to choose upgrades that best fit his gamestyle in order to have efficient progress. As game pass it becomes more challenging and requires a player to carefully balance between resources, as poor choices will significantly slow down his progress.

The game should be available on Android mobile platform.

We will use Kotlin programming language for implementation.
